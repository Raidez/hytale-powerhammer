# Power Hammer

The Power Hammer is a special hammer for builders,
it allows you to swap blocks without having to break and replace them.

## Crafting

The Power Hammer can be crafted at the basic workbench,
for almost the same cost as an iron hammer.

## Usage

When left-clicking on a *wood* block,
the Power Hammer will swap it with the first **different** *wood* block in the hotbar.

This works with any block defined as *wood* by the game:
- logs
- planks
- stairs
- slabs
- fences
- doors
- chests
- etc.

Here is a short demonstration video:

## Future Plans

1. (required) Add the ability to swap *stone* blocks and other types.
2. (required) Create a configuration to customize swappable block types.
3. (required) Add block rotation on right-click.
4. (optional) If no block is in the hotbar, behave like a classic hammer.
5. (negligible) Add a custom 3D model for the Power Hammer.
6. (negligible) Add custom sounds when using the Power Hammer.
7. (optional) Add a brush feature to swap multiple blocks at once.
8. (required) Display a message/popup in case of error (no block in hotbar, etc.).
